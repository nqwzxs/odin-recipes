# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a project consisting of a web page with links to recipes.

In this project, I used basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, ordered and unordered lists.

Images and text for description, ingredients and steps are taken from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
